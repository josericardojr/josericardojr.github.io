<p>Fluid simulation using the SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) method for my thesis master degree. For this project, I archived two way coupling between fluids and rigid bodies using a heterogeneous ambiente of CPU and GPU (CUDA) at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges<br />
</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The main challenge of this project was distribute tasks among CPU and GPU and each of these processors have its own architecture.<br />
Also, in order to minimize the data communication between GPU and CPU, which tends to reduce the overall speed, a new data structure was created.<br />
Interaction between fluid and rigid body is done by covering the 3D model surface with a collection of spheres using a technique called Depth Peeling.<br />
<strong>Features</strong></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>CPU and GPU usage.</li>
<li>Two way interaction between fluids and rigid body.</li>
<li>Depth Peeling technique for discretizing rigid bodies.</li>
</ul>
